Changes since 20070224:
  
  Patterns:
    MAC now matches CISCOMAC, WINDOWSMAC, and COMMONMAC.
    MONTH is wrapped in \b's
    TIME matches HH:MM (new) as well as HH:MM:SS

  Filters
    ip2host returns the original ip if no host is found.

  Options:
    -P flag: Outputs the regex generated by a given pattern string.

  Features:
    Predicates are now evaluated during regex matching.

    For example:
      % echo "foo foobar" | grok -m "%WORD~/bar/%" -r "%WORD%"
      foobar

    Notice how the 2nd word was matched, becuase it also matched /bar/. This is
    super useful if you have multiple pattern matches on the same line but want
    to only match the pattern that also matches another pattern.


Changes since 20070224:

  New pattern predicates:
    Operators: < > = <= >= ~
    Example:
      %NUMBER<20%
      %IP~/^192\./%
      %HOSTNAME~/google.com/%

Changes since 1.1 (2006/03/31)

  Patterns added or changed:
    - USERNAME pattern changed from \w+ to [a-zA-Z0-9_-]+
    - NUMBER
    - PROG matches \w+
    - MAC (mac address)
    - PID
    - DATA matches .* (useful for general wildcard capturing)
    - IPORHOST
    - SYSLOGPROG matches 'sshd[424]' type strings
    - HTTPDATE
    - QUOTEDSTRING
    - QS (QUOTEDSTRING shortcut)
    - SYSLOGBASE matches everything syslog normally logs before the actual message.  - APACHELOG matches a standard apache log entry

  Filters added or changed:
    - e[...] fixed to work properly
    - strftime("string format") added. Same date formats as strftime(3) but use & instead of %
    - uid2user added. Looks up a username by uid.
    - urlescape added. calls uri_escape()
    - ip2host added. Standard dns lookup.
    - httpfilter added. Turns "GET /path HTTP/1.0" to "/path"

  New features:
    - New -m and -r options for using grok from the commandline only. Specify the match
      with -m and the printing reaction with -r. See:
      http://www.semicomplete.com/blog/geekery/grok-like-grep.html

    - fancier syslog options:
      match_syslog = 1; prefixes any match with '%SYSLOGDATE% %HOST% %SYSLOGPROG%:'
      syslog_prog = "foo"; changes %PROG% in the above to be 'foo'
      syslog_host = "bar"; changes %HOST% in the above to 'bar'

    - Added more code tests:
      Test for -m and -r in place.
      Test for 'catlist' in place.
      Test for threshold hit inplace.
      Better testing framework made.

  Contributed features: (Thanks to Canaan Silberberg)
    - filelist type (like file and exec). comma-separated list of files that will
      be individually handled as if they were all invoked as 'file' entries.

    - catlist type. Same as 'filelist' but cats the files intead of 'tail -0f'ing them.

    - filecmd type (like file and exec). This will execute the given command and
      expect a list of files in return, then use those files as if you had
      specified them in a filelist
