			<p>
			PPP over SSH is a quick and dirty vpn solution. You can run a PPP
			connection over an SSH connection to make for an easy, encrypted vpn.
			Sure, there are lots of existing, prepackaged vpn solutions out there,
			but how difficult are they to setup? What do you need to install on
			*both* points of the vpn connection? Why is the sky blue?
			</p>
			<p>
			If you run any flavor of *nix (Free/Open/NetBSD, Linux, etc), chances
			are you have two things installed: ppp and ssh. With these two tools you
			can create your own encrypted vpn in only a few minutes. In this
			article, I will explain how to set it up under FreeBSD, though it should
			be similar in other OS's.

				First, you're going to need a passphraseless ssh key so we can login to your vpn gateway without a password. You do this by using the <code>ssh-keygen</code> command.
				<pre>ssh-keygen -N "" -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/ppp.key</pre>
