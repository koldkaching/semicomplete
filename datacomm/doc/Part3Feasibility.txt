Security Improvements
---------------------

1) Use SSL or TLS to encrypt communication
2) Use passworded authentication for users.
3) Upgrade protocol to be more safe and secure
	- Ensure that a player doesn't cheat through board manipulation
	- Ensure that a player can't fire more than once per turn
4) Prevent DDoS through connection flooding.
5) Ensure connection drops are handled properly (expiring player connections)


Implemented Improvements
------------------------
1) SSL encryption. This uses Diffie-Hellman as a key-exchange by default.
	Diffie-Hellman is known to be susceptible to a "Man in the middle" attack,
	where a user sits between the client and server and performs dual DH key
	exchange on either side. If you want to use a key certificate you must
	create one and tell java to use it.
	Additionally, UDP has been disabled - It is unable to be easily secured and
	such is a security risk.

	* Check Google.com for "jsse keytool" for more information on how to create
	  a certificate that java can use.

2) Password authentication for users: New users will be promtped to create a
	password. Existing users will be required to provide his or her password
	before he or she will be allowed to play.

3) Prevention of DDoS through connection flooding. IP Tracking of inbound
	connections is done. If too many connection attempts are detected from one
	IP address that IP address will be ignored.
