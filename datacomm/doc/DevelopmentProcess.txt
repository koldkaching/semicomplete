	Networked Battleship Development Process
------------------------------------------------------

Group Members:

Jordan Sissel
Tristan O'Tierney
Nicholas R. Johnson

Our team decided to split up development three ways between each
group member. The most logical way was client, server, and game.
We would collaborate on the protocol and messaging systems.

The game would be able to standalone and play locally, but then
would be able to be instantiated by the client and run in the 
network mode. This would allow a good level of abstraction in order
for each of us to work on things separately.
