Requirements
------------------------------------

For this project, we were required to implement the game Battleship
over a network using a client-server model. The rules for the game
are as defined in http://www.centralconnector.com/GAMES/battleship.html.
The program will have a centralized server that takes multiple connections.
A connection from a client includes the name of the partner to be 
associated with. Therefore, every game operating on the server has two 
clients.

* Possible Solutions and Methods


------------------------------------
Implementation
------------------------------------

The BSGame class contains all the information for a game for one player.
The BSClient class is instantiated by the BattleShipPlayer class and may
be a UDP connection to the server or a TCP connection connection to the 
server.
