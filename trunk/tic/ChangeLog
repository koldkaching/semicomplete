	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Added idle time reporting to /who output.	-
	  Wrote idletime($buddy) which returns a formatted idle time
	  string.

2004-06-05 23:09  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Unimportant comment added.

2004-06-05 22:15  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - command_who no longer quotes (with \Q and \E)
	  the regex match. I now   eval the regex and check if it's got
	  good syntax, and if so, grep the   buddylist for it.

2004-06-04 18:44  psionic

	* Tic/: Bindings.pm, Common.pm: [no log message]

2004-06-04 18:09  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - Added $state->{"away_responding"}->{"$from"},
	  which gets set to 1 in   event_im_in if you are away. This is
	  used by command_msg to determine if	you are away or not. I
	  should do this better :(

2004-06-04 18:08  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Removed out(), real_out(), and error() which are
	  provided by Term::Shelly

2004-06-04 18:07  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Fixed a bug where if you did "/msg foo" it
	  would try to send a blank   message despite code existing which
	  should have prevented it.  - Added $state->{"away_responding"}
	  which gets set when tic   auto-responds with your away message.
	  This is so that while you are   away, all of your messages aren't
	  flagged as being your away message

2004-06-04 18:05  psionic

	* Tic/Bindings.pm: - Resurrected! :) - Does it's original job of
	  providing input-oriented functionality. It   extends the existing
	  functionality of Term::Shelly and includes a	 completer
	  function.  - The completer function currently supports commands
	  and completing   names for /msg and /m only. More to come soon
	  when I create a flexible   framework.  - Also wrote in the
	  expand-line keybinding again, hitting ^T will expand	 the
	  aliases on the current line.	- Added complete_lastfrom() which
	  is executed when you hit ';' on the	beginning of the line. It
	  replaces ; with   /msg <person who messaged you last> - Wrote
	  match_buddies which takes a partial and returns buddies matching
	  it.

2004-06-04 18:02  psionic

	* tic: - Resurrected Tic::Bindings. I needed it afterall to do
	  special   functional enhancements over what Term::Shelly
	  provides. <3 flexibility

2004-06-04 02:21  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - Integrated Term::Shelly. Yadda yadda yadda.

2004-06-04 02:20  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Integrated Term::Shelly, so some things had to
	  be changed:	login() used to block until we got a user and pass.
	  This is not so   anymore. The chain of events is:

	    login() - sets the callback of Shelly to be get_username(),
	  which is
	    given the username and then sets the call back to
	  get_password(),
	    which is given the password (after input, duh) and then runs
	    do_login() which logs you in and resets the callback to the
	  oringal
	    one tic uses to execute commands
	  ($state->{"command_callback"}).

	    Also got rid of out(), error(), fix_inputline(), etc... these
	  are all
	    now in Term::Shelly

	  - Got rid of query(), it was deprecated by Term::Shelly

2004-06-04 02:18  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Integrated Term::Shelly, out() and error() are
	  now $sh->out(), etc.	- Fixed a typo in the idle /who output

2004-06-04 02:17  psionic

	* tic: - Integrated Term::Shelly. Got rid of all my kludgly input
	  code.  Finally! As such, tic (the file) has WAAAAY less code in
	  it. Goodie :) - Had to update all the out() and error() functions
	  to be $sh->out() etc

2004-06-01 21:51  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Moved %USERFLAGS to the top, it only needs to
	  be declared once.  - Changed the -o flag to mean "online." Also
	  moved the offline flag to -f

2004-06-01 21:50  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - Typo again, used a < instead of a > in the time
	  comparison with away message responses.

2004-06-01 02:19  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Fixed up command_who: Now supports the
	  following flags, which can be combined:    -a     Show only
	  active users	  -i	 Show only idle users	  -w	 Show only
	  away users	 -m	Show only mobile users	 -o	Show only
	  offline users The new syntax is: /who [-aiwmo] [regex]

	  All options are optional.

2004-06-01 00:55  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - Updated event_im_in to properly autorespond with
	  the current away message

2004-06-01 00:54  psionic

	* Tic/Constants.pm: - Changed im_awaymsg's text to be [AWAY] <*xs*>
	  %m I'll make this prettier later, I don't care for now ...

2004-06-01 00:53  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Fixed a possible off by one bug where one too
	  many characters were being displayed when the line was too long
	  to show on the terminal.

2004-06-01 00:52  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Added command_addbuddy, command_delbuddy, and
	  command_away - Modified command_msg to set the 3rd argument of
	  $aim->send_im() to 1 if we are currently away, undef otherwise
	  (as per Net::OSCAR documentation)

2004-06-01 00:51  psionic

	* tic: - Added /addbuddy, /away, and /delbuddy - Fixed an
	  off-by-one bug where if you ran text off the edge of the
	  terminal and caused scrolling of the line, then backspaced, it
	  would   display one too many characters.

2004-05-31 17:26  psionic

	* Tic/Bindings.pm: - Fixed off-by-one-ness where if you typed
	  beyond the end of the   terminal, then backspaced, it would print
	  one-too-many characters.

2004-05-30 22:45  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - typo :(

2004-05-30 22:20  psionic

	* tic, Tic/Bindings.pm, Tic/Commands.pm, Tic/Common.pm,
	  Tic/Constants.pm: - Bugfixes, etc... You don't care.

2004-05-30 15:50  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - buddy_in events are now processed correctly when
	  buddies log on.

2004-03-07 02:59  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - changed instances of $state->{"config"}->{...}
	  to get_config(...)

2004-03-07 02:59  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Moved set_config() and get_config() to here.

2004-03-07 02:58  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Added command_date() - prints out the time -
	  Moved get_config() and set_config() to Tic::Common - Fixed a few
	  misc bugs here and there

2004-03-07 02:51  psionic

	* Tic/Bindings.pm: - added Tic::Common->set_state() to set_state

2004-03-07 01:26  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Added support for port and host in the case that
	  you may want to connect to   a nonstandard port or host. In
	  ~/.ticrc:   port=8080

	    For example, would make you connect to login.oscar.aol.com port
	  8080
	    (which does in fact work).

2004-03-07 01:10  psionic

	* tic, Tic/Common.pm: [no log message]

2004-03-07 00:18  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: [no log message]

2004-03-07 00:18  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - Modified error output to include an error
	  number, *shrug*

2004-03-07 00:16  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Modified fix_inputline() to support long lines

2004-03-07 00:15  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Added new features to /who (command_who)	You
	  can do: /who [-active|-idle|-away|regex] to pull certain kinds of
	  buddies - Added errors for command_msg if no buddy or message is
	  specified

2004-03-07 00:13  psionic

	* tic: - Removed some debug output

2004-03-07 00:04  psionic

	* Tic/Bindings.pm: - Modified backward_char() and forward_char() to
	  support modification of   $state->{"leftcol"} - thus letting you
	  scroll back and forth using the   arrow keys to scroll long longs
	  - Also commented out lots of STDERR prints

2004-03-07 00:01  psionic

	* tic: - Modified check_readline() to handle a output better.
	  long-lines are supported   now. It'll scroll you off to the right
	  if you type too much.  - Fixed read_config() to ignore blank
	  lines

2004-03-04 07:09  psionic

	* test.pl: [no log message]

2004-03-04 07:08  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Changed prettyprint() to not display the message
	  type, it was debugging info.

2004-03-04 07:07  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Added some various debugging statements to
	  help with processing - Started working on better handling of
	  argument processing

2004-03-04 07:06  psionic

	* tic: - Cleaned out no-longer-used code and modules - added
	  $settings ($state->{"settings"}). Configuration data is stored
	  here.    This includes thinsg read in from the now-supported rc
	  file (~/.ticrc)  - Added support for a ~/.ticrc   Syntax is:
	  key = value	Comments are marked by #, whitespace between the =,
	  key and values are   ignored. Currently supported options are:
	  screenname, password	 For Example:	screenname =  psikronic -
	  Attempted to add support for dynamic window sizings, but
	  apparently setting   $SIG{WINCH} (SIGWINCH, Signal sent when the
	  term size changes) causes   the Net::OSCAR connection to die,
	  it's fucked up. I'm looking into it.	- added read_config()

2004-02-28 19:46  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - Added "aimok" state toggle off when a fatal
	  error occurs.

2004-02-28 18:43  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Remvoed stty() - Fixed deep_copy() to use map()
	  instead.  - Added login();

2004-02-28 18:41  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Fixed argument handling in command_msg() -
	  Moved login() to Tic::Common

2004-02-28 18:40  psionic

	* tic: - Moved login() to Tic::Common - Fixed 'default' messaging
	  behavior

2004-01-03 22:52  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - wierd...

2004-01-03 22:17  psionic

	* tic, Tic/Bindings.pm: - Removed some debug stuff

2004-01-03 22:16  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - /help alone now prints out contents of /help
	  /help

2004-01-02 05:54  psionic

	* tic, Tic/Common.pm, Tic/Constants.pm, Tic/Events.pm: - Added $Id$
	  tags

2004-01-02 05:53  psionic

	* Tic/: Bindings.pm, Commands.pm: - Added $Id$ stuff to the top of
	  the file - Made a meta syntax for completion. Commands now
	  specify how to complete   their own arguments! :)   %s =
	  screenname   %c = command or alias   %a = alias   %ca = read the
	  previous command's arguments

	    What does that last one mean?
	    Well, the completion for /alias is: "%a %c %ca"
	    and the completion for /msg is: %s
	    which means when you type: /alias foo /msg bar*TAB*
	    it will:
	       See that you are on the 4th token of the input. Then see
	  that /alias
	       is being used and look up it's completion string. Then see
	  that only
	       the first two parameters are defined and that the 3rd and on
	  are defined
	       by the 2nd parameter (a command). So it then sees that /msg
	  is the 2nd
	       parameter to /alias, and treats "bar" as the 1st parameter
	  to /msg and
	       completes it based on that. So it will try to complete "bar"
	  to a known
	       screen name. Got it?

	    Now doing completion is loads easier because I don't have to
	  hand-code
	    anything for new commands, I can simply have them define new
	  completions.
	    This goes for everyone else too, and makes it far easier to
	  maintain in
	    the future if someone wants to hack on it.

	    This change affects Bindings.pm and Commands.pm

2004-01-02 05:52  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - Fixed a bug where idle and away status messages
	  weren't being handled right.

2004-01-02 05:52  psionic

	* Tic/Constants.pm: - Added nohelp and alias_is default outputs

2004-01-02 05:51  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Added more metas to prettyprint, see
	  Tic/Common.pm for what they all are.

2004-01-02 05:50  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Added command_help. It does the obvious. It
	  also will define aliases if you   do /help /<some alias> - Also
	  added help context for all the current methods. Now, it is easy
	  to add   new help information becuase each command documents
	  itself. Calling   command_*("help") will return a help message.

2004-01-02 05:48  psionic

	* Tic/Bindings.pm: - Added do_complete_buddy and do_complete_alias,
	  they take the   same parameters as do_complete_command. It's
	  obvious what they do.

2004-01-02 05:41  psionic

	* tic: - call prepare_completion() before we do any real work. (See
	  Tic::Bindings) - Made it so pasting wasn't annoying. Excerpt from
	  the code explaining:	  $aim->do_one_loop() sleeps for .01
	  seconds waiting for data. This is time    that could be better
	  spent reading from the input. So, what I did	  is every time a
	  key is read set $state->{"aimok"} to 0. And any time
	  check_readline() does not read a keypress $state->{"aimok"} is
	  set to 1.	This makes it so pasting things is very fast
	  because while you're pasting	   $aim->do_one_loop() is never
	  called.

2004-01-01 21:33  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - Cleaned up the debug code. Now displays when
	  people go away and come back.    Same is displayed for idle.

2004-01-01 21:33  psionic

	* tic: - Updated mkdir() call on line 18

2004-01-01 16:51  psionic

	* Tic/: Bindings.pm, Commands.pm, Common.pm, Constants.pm,
	  Events.pm: - Commit to try and get this working with perl 5.005

2004-01-01 16:40  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Typo fix

2004-01-01 16:39  psionic

	* Tic/: Bindings.pm, Commands.pm, Common.pm, Constants.pm,
	  Events.pm: - instead of using our I do use vars qw(@ISA @EXPORT)
	  now for compat with older   versions of perl.

2003-12-31 07:43  psionic

	* Tic/Constants.pm: - unimportant commit, I'm bored and tired.

2003-12-31 07:43  psionic

	* tic: - Added checks to create ~/.tic/ if it doesn't exist.

2003-12-31 07:21  psionic

	* Tic/Events.pm: - fixed set_state() to work properly, i forgot
	  that the first argument is   always $self when calling a sub on
	  an object or class.  - updated all the output statements to use
	  prettyprint() - added missing output statements (now prettyprint)
	  to several of the   unimplemented events.

2003-12-31 07:19  psionic

	* Tic/Constants.pm: - Added DEFAULT_OUTPUT which sets all of the
	  default text formatting. This   includes timestamp format,
	  inbound message format, etc

2003-12-31 07:18  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Added deep_copy(), does a one-level deep copy of
	  a hash - Added prettyprint(). This sub handles printing normal
	  messages - Added prettylog(), which is a short wrapper around
	  prettyprint(). Instead of   printing to STDOUT it will open a log
	  and print to it. Hurray for perl's   select() function making
	  this simple.	- Updated out() to fix repost the input line (if
	  there is one).  - Updated error() to also repost the input line -
	  Added fix_inputline() which reposts the current input line and
	  positions   the cursor accordingly.  - prettyprint supports
	  special escapes to insert certain pieces of text:    %s -
	  Screenname of target (or who is messaging you)   %m - Message
	  text	     %g - Group the user belongs to  %c - chatroom relted
	  to this message    %w - warning level      %i - idle time of the
	  user	    %e - error message	    %S - your own screen name
	  %% - literal % - added getrealsn() which takes a normalized
	  screen name (ie; psikronic) and   turns it into "PsiKronic" by
	  looking it up.

2003-12-31 07:12  psionic

	* Tic/Commands.pm: - Added /log on - to re-enable logging if it was
	  disabled.  - Added command_sn, this won't stay around long.  -
	  Added /timestamp to enable/disable timestamping

2003-12-31 07:10  psionic

	* Tic/Bindings.pm: - Renamed the bindings to things that aren't
	  bind_* - Also renamed the bind_* subs to more fun names.  - added
	  set_state() so we can somewhat maintain state - Added
	  do_complete_command() split from do_complete(). This will take a
	  partial word and complete it to a command or alias.	- Added
	  extra completion for the 2nd word of the alias command. So doing:
	  /alias foo /bu*TAB*   will complete "/bu" to "/buddylist" and
	  such.

2003-12-31 07:07  psionic

	* tic: - Moved event_* subs to Tic::Events - Moved command_* subs
	  to Tic::Commands

2003-12-31 02:05  psionic

	* Tic/Common.pm: - Updated Exporter shenanigans

2003-12-31 02:04  psionic

	  complete commands.

2003-12-28 22:42  psionic

	* tic: - Huzzah commit (I'm too lazy to read cvs diff -u and update
	  the log here.)

2003-12-28 22:19  psionic

	* Tic/Constants.pm: - Instead of hashes, we use constants now.

2003-12-27 19:54  psionic

	* Tic/Constants.pm: - Super magical fun happy place where constants
	  stay.

2003-12-27 19:24  psionic
