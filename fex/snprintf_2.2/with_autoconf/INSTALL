HOW TO INSTALL - with autoconf:

  1. Read the description of macros that control the bahaviour
     of the program at the beginning of the file snprintf.c,
     change the definitions in snprintf.c if necessary.

     Note that snprintf.c and snprintf.h are just symbolic links
     to a parent directory.

  2. ./configure 
     make
     make install

  3a. set up your program with autoconf along the lines of this example

  dnl confirms that you have a working snprintf
  AC_caolan_FUNC_SNPRINTF
  if test x$ac_cv_func_snprintf = xno; then
  	dnl will add -lsnprintf to your libs if it exists and defines HAVE_PKG_snprintf
  	AC_caolan_CHECK_PACKAGE(snprintf,snprintf,snprintf,snprintf.h,,NO_SNPRINTF=true)
	if test x$NO_SNPRINTF = xtrue; then
	    AC_MSG_WARN(Couldn't find a suitable snprintf implementation!\n  Try at http://www.ijs.si/software/snprintf/)
	fi
  fi
  dnl AC_caolan_FUNC_SNPRINTF and AC_caolan_CHECK_PACKAGE can be gotten 
  dnl at http://www.csn.ul.ie/~caolan/publink/autoconf
  dnl place then in your aclocal dir (/usr/local/share/aclocal perhaps)
  dnl and run aclocal before running autoconf, when running autoheader
  dnl various symbols will be missing, add the missing ones as
  dnl #undef symbol lines into acconfig.h
  dnl 
  dnl you then should have in your source code...
  dnl #ifdef HAVE_PKG_snprintf
  dnl #include <snprintf.h>
  dnl #endif
  dnl I place mine in acconfig.h and include config.h in every source file.

  3b. Alternatively you can not install snprintf as a library but instead
  	move the file snprintf.o where your program will find it and work out
	your own tests
