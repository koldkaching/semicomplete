  * Add flag SIZE_RESPECTINCREMENT to xdo_window_setsize
  * Add flag --respect_incrememnt to xdotool windowsize

  Increments are used often in terminals that say "my font is 5 by 7 pixels, so
  resize by that increment". So, you can use this to set a terminal to be 80x24
  characters instead of pixels. Verified by resizing xterm and gnome-terminal         (with menus enabled).

  Added new search options to 'xdotool search'
    --onlyvisible shows only visible windows in the results
    --title causes only the window title to be matched
    --name causes the window name to be matched
    --class causes the window class to be matched

  For information on names and classes, check out the xprop tool.
    For example, for an xterm you will see this in the xprop output:
    WM_CLASS(STRING) = "xterm", "XTerm"
  "xterm" is the name, "XTerm" is the class. Don't ask me what the differences
  are supposed to be. ;)
