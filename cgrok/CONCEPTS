Concepts:
  - inputs
  - input filter (external program, like gzip -dc)
  - match tests
  - match counts (by key)
  - reactions

Inputs:
  - file, file glob, file list
  - execution

  Files:
    - watch for log rotations (default)

  Execution:
    - shell command
    - re-execution interval (integer, optional)
    - restart-on-death (boolean, optional)
    - restart-on-death-delay 
      (1 second? don't want to loop restarting a broken procses)

Input filters:
  - permit external programs (gzip -dc and such)

Match tests:
  - patterns to match
  - match key

Reaction:
  - hit threshold (n hits per m timeperiod)
  - execute command reaction
